For my corpus, i have chosen my own spotify playlist called "Nobodylistenstotechno". This is a corpus of 218+ songs with multiple genres under which techno, hardtechno, early hardstyle, hardcore and industrial hardcore, which gives it a good variety in tempo, groove and release date. Some of the early hardstyle is from beginning 2000, while other, newer, techno tracks are released as recently as this year (2023). 
The clear 4x4 beat pattern in techno must make this playlist very interesting to have a look at, since there is a clear feature in all tracks what they have in common, while also having loads of differences. This is also the reason why i chose this corpus.
